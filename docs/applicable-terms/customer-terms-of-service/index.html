<li><a href="/docs-exp/docs/applicable-terms/additional-terms/terms-of-use"><strong>Terms of Use and Acceptable Use Policy:</strong> </a>These documents describe what Users can and can’t do while using our Services.

<li><strong>Data-Specific Agreements:</strong> Depending on the location of the Customer and the applicable privacy regulations, Customer may be required to agree to a data agreement with Rocket.Chat. If you are required to agree to a data agreement with us, it will be added by reference to these terms. You can find information related to privacy agreements within Clause 6 (of this agreement) and in the <a href="https://app.gitbook.com/o/-M41dOPtnjO7qK6KCyrt/s/NQRwqdF7Dy93Q5Mw0kzs/rocket.chat-privacy-and-security/privacy-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Center</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ordering Documents:</strong> If applicable, any Order Forms, Subscriptions or Statements of Work (each, an “Ordering Document”) entered between Customer and Rocket.Chat shall be attached to and made a part of the Agreement</li>

<p>We update the Customer Terms and Additional Terms from time to time. If you have an active Rocket.Chat subscription we will let you know when we update the terms via in-app notification (through the Workspace Admin account) or by email. Continued use of the Services after any updates become effective constitute Customer’s agreement to be bound by the revised Agreement. Thus, if Customer does not accept a change to any terms, Customer should stop using or accessing the Services.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated in the Service Specific Terms, the Customer is authorized to use the Service solely for its business purposes. Unless the parties have entered into an executed a Partner Agreement, Customer is expressly prohibited from sublicensing or reselling the Services to any third party. The Customer&#x27;s right to use the Service is limited only to those expressly granted in the Agreement, including any Service Specific Terms. No other rights, except those explicitly granted in the Agreement, with respect to the Service or any related Rocket.Chat Intellectual Property shall be implied.</p>

<p>Upon payment of all fees and subject to continuous compliance with this Agreement, Rocket.Chat hereby grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access, use, and install (if applicable) the Services during the Term. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer may provide, make available to, or permit its End-Users to use or access the Services in whole or in part; provided that Customer shall be responsible for its End Users’ use of the Service. Customer agrees that Rocket.Chat may deliver the Services to the Customer with the assistance of its Affiliates, licensors, and service providers. During the Term, Rocket.Chat may update or modify the Services to reflect changes in, among other things, laws, regulations, rules, technology, industry practices, patterns of system use, and availability of a third-party program. Rocket.Chat’s updates or modifications to the Services will not materially reduce the level of performance, functionality, security, or availability of the Services during the Term.</p>

<p>Rocket.Chat offers two deployment options for its services: Self-Hosted or Cloud Hosting. It is important to note that there are specific Appendices in these Customer Terms that apply only to one type of deployment. Furthermore, the privacy handling also varies for each deployment option. Appendix 1 covers the Self-Hosted Specific Clauses, while Appendix 2 covers the Cloud Hosting option. For more details, please refer to these appendices and the Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="25-no-charge-services">2.5 No-Charge Services.<a href="#25-no-charge-services" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.5 No-Charge Services." title="Direct link to 2.5 No-Charge Services.">​</a></h3>
<p>Rocket.Chat may offer certain Services to Customers at no charge, including free accounts, trial use, and Beta Versions as defined below (collectively, “No-Charge Products”). Customer use of No-Charge Services is subject to any additional terms that we specify and is only permitted during the Subscription Term we designate (or if not designated, until terminated in accordance with this Agreement). Except as otherwise set forth in these Customer Terms, the terms and conditions of these Customer Terms fully apply to No-Charge Services. We may modify or terminate your right to use No-Charge Services at any time and for any reason at our sole discretion, without liability to you. You understand that any pre-release and Beta Services and any pre-release and Beta features that we make available (collectively, “Beta Versions”) are still under development, may be inoperable or incomplete, and will likely contain more errors and bugs than generally available Services. We make no promises that any Beta Versions will ever be made generally available. In some circumstances, we may charge a fee in order to allow you to access Beta Versions, but the Beta Versions will still remain subject to this Section. All information regarding the characteristics, features, or performance of any No-Charge Products (including Beta Versions) constitutes our Confidential Information. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Rocket.Chat disclaims all representations, warranties, obligations or liabilities with respect to No-Charge Products, including any Support Services, warranty, and indemnity obligations. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE IN THE AGREEMENT, OUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY RELATING TO ANY NO-CHARGE PRODUCTS WILL BE US$100.\</p>

<p>Customer may not (i) provide, make available to, or permit individuals other than its End Users to use or access the Services, the Software, or Documentation, in whole or in part; (ii) use the Services or Software to store or transmit infringing, libelous, unlawful, or tortious material or to store or transmit material in violation of third party rights, including privacy rights; (iii) use the Services or Software to violate any rights of third parties; (iv) use the Services or Software to store or transmit malicious code, Trojan horses, malware, spam, viruses, or other destructive technology (&quot;Viruses&quot;); (v) interfere with, impair, or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services or any other third party’s use of the Services or (vi) alter, circumvent, or provide the means to alter or circumvent the Services or Software, including technical limitations, recurring fees, or usage limits.</p>

<p>Through the Rocket.Chat Services, Customer may be able to specify certain End Users as “Administrators,” users who have important rights and controls over Customer’s use of Rocket.Chat Services and End User accounts. This may include entering into Ordering Documents for Rocket.Chat Services; creating, de-provisioning, monitoring, or modifying End User Accounts, and setting End User usage permissions; and managing access to Customer Data by End Users or others. Administrators may also take over management of accounts previously registered using an email address belonging to Customer domain (which become “managed accounts”, as described in our Documentation). Without limiting Section 4.5 (Responsibility for End Users), which fully applies to Administrators, Customer is responsible any acts or omissions of its Administrators. Customer agrees that Rocket.Chat’s responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the Rocket.Chat Services for Customer.</p>

<p>Customer will provide all required disclosures to and will obtain and maintain all required consents from End Users to allow: (i) Administrators to have the access described in the Agreement and the Privacy Policy; and (ii) Rocket.Chat’s provision of the Rocket.Chat Services to Administrators and End Users.

<p>Rocket.Chat’s Terms of Use will be presented to End Users during the sign-up, account creation, and registration process for Rocket.Chat Services, as well as within the product itself, which End Users must agree to before they can access the Services. Certain Customers may have the option to put forth their own terms of use in addition to Rocket.Chat’s Term of Use. If Customer customizes the Rocket.Chat Services and adds terms of use on the login page, it is Customer&#x27;s responsibility to ensure that each End User either (i) agrees to Rocket.Chat’s Terms of Use to End Users in addition to Customer’s terms of use; or (ii) to include Rocket.Chat’s Terms of Use and Acceptable Use policy content within its Customer’s terms of use, and to ensure that each End User agrees to Customer’s terms of use. Customer may add additional requirements into it terms of use and/or acceptable use policies, as long as such terms of use and acceptable use policies also comply with (and do not conflict with) the Rocket.Chat Terms of Use, Acceptable Use Policie and applicable regulations. Customers shall be responsible for any damages that may result from Customer’s failure to do so.</p>

<p>Customer is responsible for understanding the settings and controls for each Rocket.Chat Services accessed by Customer and for controlling whom Customer allows to become an End User. Some Rocket.Chat Services may allow Customer to designate different types of End Users (for example, Rocket.Chat Software distinguishes between “Users” and “Guest user”), in which case pricing and functionality may vary according to the type of End User. Customer is responsible for compliance with this Agreement by all End Users, including for any payment obligations, as well as for all End Users’ activities of all your End Users, including Ordering Documents they may place and how End Users use or upload Customer Data, even if those End Users are not from Customer’s organization or domain.</p>

<p>Customer may have the option to &#x27;white label&#x27; Rocket.Chat’s Services by rebranding the Rocket.Chat Services with Customer’s branding. By integrating any logo, name, branding or other indicia of origin (“Customer Marks”) into the Rocket.Chat Services, Customer hereby represents and warrants to Rocket.Chat that Customer is the sole and exclusive owner of all Customer Marks or that Customer has otherwise obtained all necessary rights, permissions and consents to integrate the Customer Marks in the Rocket.Chat Services. Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Rocket.Chat and its officers, directors, employees, shareholders and representatives, from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, causes of action or injuries, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in connection with third party claims arising from or related to a claim that Customer Marks violate or infringe a third party’s patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or any other intellectual property rights.</p>
