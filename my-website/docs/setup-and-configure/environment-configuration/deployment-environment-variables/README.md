# Deployment Environment Variables

Environmental variables can be specified to affect how the workspace is deployed or affect the workspace settings and configuration. Setting the deployment environment variables depends on the deployment method of choice. This topic takes you through the mandatory and optional deployment environment variables for you to successfully deploy your workspace as per your needs.

Using the most common deployment method [deploy-with-docker-and-docker-compose.md](../../../deploy/deploy-rocket.chat/deploy-with-docker-and-docker-compose.md "mention") these variables can be set in the `compose.yml` file.

## Mandatory Environment Variables


## Optional Environment Variables


After configuring the mandatory and optional deployment environment variables, see how to manage your workspace settings with environment variables in the next topic.
